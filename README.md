# EnSecacy-V3
Detect and Remove "ALL" MIUI Bloatwares and "Enhance" your Privacy

About EnSecacy:
	EnSecacy's expansion is Enhanced Security and Privacy. Although it's not "really" enhanced, this script will help you in getting out of trackers
  and Ads that can be seen on Xiaomi Phones. By using this script, I  BET, YOU'LL BE SATISFIED after executing my script EnSecacy.
		No body on this earth wants their personal data to be shared with anyone, right? Yeah!

And this is what led me to create EnSecacy and create this repo.

It's developed by Pavana Narayana Bhat AKA pixincreate(the guy you see on YouTube especially).
V3 is the 3rd version and I've uploaded it right here.


Steps to followed to use this script:
	1. Enable Developer Options by going to ABOUT >> SYSTEM >> Click the BUILD NUMBER 7 times (Universally) incase of MIUI, Click MIUI VERSION 7 times.
	2. Enable USB Debugging
	3. Download and Run the EnSecacy.exe script within the DOWNLOADED folder itself, else it will not work.
	Everything else has been elaborated in EnSecacy.exe itself in detail.
