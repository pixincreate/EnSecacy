## Reporting a Vulnerability

Create an issue in this repository.

Newer versions will be released based on the MIUI updates. I.e., if Xiaomi makes any sort of changes,
then, a new version will be released for sure.
However, MIUI 12, Android 10, now is not supported as Xiaomi has messed up with ADB.
