# EnSecacy! The Journey from AdUI to AdlessUI
Detect and Remove "ALL" MIUI Bloatwares and "Enhance" your Privacy.

## About EnSecacy:
   **EnSecacy**'s expansion is Enhanced Security and Privacy. Although it's not "really" enhanced,
this script will help you in getting out of trackers
and Ads that can be seen on Xiaomi Phones. By using this script, I  BET, YOU'LL BE SATISFIED after
executing my script EnSecacy. **No body on this earth wants their personal data to be shared with anyone, right?** Yeah!

And this is what led me to create EnSecacy and create this repo.
It's developed by Pavana Narayana Bhat AKA pixincreate(the guy you see on YouTube especially).

Everything else has been elaborated in EnSecacy.exe itself in detail.
